Project Overview

This project aims to develop machine learning models to predict customer churn (cancellation) for Let's Talk, a telecommunications company. By identifying customers at high risk of churn, Let's Talk can implement targeted retention strategies, minimizing customer loss and maximizing revenue.

Motivation

In the realm of data science, classification problems are widely encountered. Customer churn prediction falls under this category, where the dependent variable (customer churn) is categorical (churn vs. non-churn). Accurately predicting churn requires addressing missing data effectively, employing sound feature engineering techniques, and selecting appropriate evaluation metrics.

Object of Study

Churn prediction is a crucial concern for many companies, enabling them to anticipate customer cancellations and take proactive measures. Early identification of churn-prone customers empowers marketing, CRM, and sales teams to tailor retention efforts for maximum impact. Churn prediction models leverage historical customer data, encompassing characteristics of customers who have churned and those who haven't. This information can be invaluable for banks, phone companies, retailers, and any service provider with customer data.

Project Goal

This project seeks to assist Let's Talk in retaining customers. We will construct classification models to categorize customers as either "churn" (likely to cancel) or "non-churn."

Data Source

The dataset used in this project simulates a real-world telecommunications scenario. It can be downloaded from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn. This publicly available dataset comprises customer demographics, contracted services, and churn information for a fictitious telephone company.
